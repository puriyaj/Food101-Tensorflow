# Food101 Project

## Overview

The **Food101 Project** utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images into 101 distinct food categories. This project is built upon the EfficientNetB0 architecture to achieve enhanced classification performance.

## Key Features

- **CNN Model**: Implements EfficientNetB0 for advanced food image classification.
- **Dataset**: Trained on a comprehensive dataset covering 101 different food categories.
- **Performance**: Surpasses the DeepFood paper (2016), which achieved 77.4% top-1 accuracy with a similar CNN approach.

## Achievements

By applying fine-tuning techniques, this project exceeds the benchmark set by DeepFood, demonstrating superior accuracy in food classification tasks.
